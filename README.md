# TableauChallenge

I decided to inspect the 2020 data. I downloaded all 12 months and used Jupyter Notebook to view the files and data. I then used Pandas to combine all CSV files into 1 and export out to use for my analysis. My Jupyter Notebook is uploaded to my GitRepo and the published Tableau link to my workbook/story is below.
